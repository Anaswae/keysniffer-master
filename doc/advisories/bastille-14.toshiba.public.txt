Bastille Threat Research Team Tracking Number 14
Document version: 1.0

Overview

The Toshiba PA3871U-1ETB wireless keyboard does not encrypt packets transmitted over the air, 
making it possible to sniff keystrokes typed by the user, and inject arbitrary keystrokes into 
the computer. 



Affected Platforms

The following products have been tested and shown to be affected:

- Toshiba PA3871U-1ETB wireless keyboard
- Toshiba PA3844D USB dongle (USB ID 0458:00ce)



Impact

The keyboard and USB dongle communicate using an unencrypted wireless protocol, making it possible 
to sniff keystrokes and inject malicious keystrokes.



Mitigation

Exploiting this vulnerability involves wirelessly communicating with a USB dongle, which requires 
physical proximity to the target computer. 



Suggested Solutions 

No solution available for recommendation.
