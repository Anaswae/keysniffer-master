Bastille Threat Research Team Tracking Number 10
Document version: 1.0

Overview

The Anker Ultra Slim 2.4GHz Wireless Compact Keyboard does not encrypt packets transmitted over
the air, making it possible to sniff keystrokes typed by the user, and inject arbitrary keystrokes 
into the computer. 



Affected Platforms

The following products have been tested and shown to be affected:

- Anker Ultra Slim 2.4GHz Wireless Compact Keyboard
- Anker USB dongle (USB ID 062a:4101)



Impact

The keyboard and USB dongle communicate using an unencrypted wireless protocol, making it possible 
to sniff keystrokes and inject malicious keystrokes.



Mitigation

Exploiting this vulnerability involves wirelessly communicating with a USB dongle, which requires 
physical proximity to the target computer. 



Suggested Solutions 

No solution available for recommendation.
